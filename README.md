## Motivation

This project is a compagnion to our [templates repo](https://github.com/AtelierNum/templates).

The github ecosytem (and more broadly, git) is a great tool for collaboration but also a barrier for anyone not aquainted with it.

So this tool aim to let anyone browse then download the template they need.
